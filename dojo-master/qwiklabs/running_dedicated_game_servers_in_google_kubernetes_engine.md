# Goal
- Create a container image of a popular open-source dedicated game server (DGS) on Linux using Docker. This container image adds only the binaries and necessary libraries to a base Linux image
- Store the assets on a separate read-only persistent disk volume and mount them in the container at run-time
- Setup and configure basic scheduler processes using the Kubernetes and Google Cloud APIs to spin up and down nodes to meet demand

# Task
- [ ] Containerizing the dedicated game server
- [ ] Creating a dedicated game server binaries container image
- [ ] Setting up a Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Setting up the scaling manager
- [ ] Testing the setup
- [ ] Connecting to the DGS
- [ ] Testing the scaling manager
