# Goal
- Use BigQuery to find public datasets
- Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
- Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
- Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BQML
- Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
- Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase

# Task
- [x] Explore ecommerce data
- [x] Identify an objective
- [x] Select features and create your training dataset
- [x] Create BigQuery dataset to store models
- [x] Select a BQML model type and specify options
- [x] Evaluate classification model performance
- [x] Improve model performance with Feature Engineering
- [x] Predict which new visitors will come back and purchase

# Supplement
