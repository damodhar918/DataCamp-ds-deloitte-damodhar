# Goal
- Set up your environment by launching Google Cloud Shell, creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster, and configuring your identity and user management scheme
- Download a sample application, create a Git repository then upload it to a Google Cloud Source Repository
- Deploy Spinnaker to Kubernetes Engine using Helm
- Build your Docker image
- Create triggers to create Docker images when your application changes
- Configure a Spinnaker pipeline to reliably and continuously deploy your application to Kubernetes Engine
- Deploy a code change, triggering the pipeline, and watch it roll out to production
