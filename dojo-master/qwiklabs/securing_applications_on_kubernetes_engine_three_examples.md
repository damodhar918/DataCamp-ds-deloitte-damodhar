# Goal
- Host access: describes what permissions an application has on it's host node, outside of its container. This is controlled via Pod and Container security contexts, as well as app armor profiles
- Network access: describes what other resources or workloads an application can access via the network. This is controlled with NetworkPolicies
- Kubernetes API access: describes which API calls an application is allowed to make against. API access is controlled using the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model via Role and RoleBinding definitions
