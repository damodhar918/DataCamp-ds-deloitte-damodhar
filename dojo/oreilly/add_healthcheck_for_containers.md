# 1. Creating Service
```Dockerfile
FROM katacoda/docker-http-server:health
HEALTHCHECK --timeout=1s --interval=1s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -s --fail http://localhost:80/ || exit 1
```

```sh
Your Interactive Bash Terminal. A safe place to learn and execute commands.

$ docker build -t http .

# 2. Crash Service
```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                NAMES

$ curl http://docker/unhealthy
```

# 3. Verify Status
```sh
$ docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health.Status }}" srv
"unhealthy"
$ docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" srv
{"Status":"unhealthy","FailingStreak":48,"Log":[{"Start":"2020-03-07T01:10:52.99480533Z","End":"2020-03-07T01:10:53.042402583Z","ExitCode":1,"Output":""},{"Start":"2020-03-07T01:10:54.048449606Z","End":"2020-03-07T01:10:54.097565081Z","ExitCode":1,"Output":""},{"Start":"2020-03-07T01:10:55.103429673Z","End":"2020-03-07T01:10:55.158515221Z","ExitCode":1,"Output":""},{"Start":"2020-03-07T01:10:56.166361404Z","End":"2020-03-07T01:10:56.21747501Z","ExitCode":1,"Output":""},{"Start":"2020-03-07T01:10:57.222655272Z","End":"2020-03-07T01:10:57.275237598Z","ExitCode":1,"Output":""}]}
$ docker ps

```

# 4. Fix Service
```sh
$ curl http://docker/healthy
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS                NAMES

$ docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health.Status }}" srv
"healthy"
```

# 5. Healthchecks with Swarm
```sh
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa);
8b576f16fec0
$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (lx3abqwifwv2i129ct6eppc1p) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-021mth2nahpj4zdsxpoaxnxra33shdqms11zntlxzs4rjlh36n-2s7o71d4uwooxnn0n7z4bx8lc 172.17.0.25:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

$ docker service create --name http --replicas 2 -p 80:80 http
image http:latest could not be accessed on a registry to record
its digest. Each node will access http:latest independently,
possibly leading to different nodes running different
versions of the image.
