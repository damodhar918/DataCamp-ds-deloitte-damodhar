# Goal
- How to deploy a microservices application on an existing GKE cluster
- How to select appropriate SLIs/SLOs for an application
- How to implement SLIs using Stackdriver Monitoring features
- How to use Stackdriver Trace, Profiler, and Debugger to identify software issues

# Task
- [x] Environment Setup
- [x] Infrastructure setup
- [x] Create Stackdriver workspace
- [x] Deploy application
- [x] Develop Sample SLOs and SLIs
- [x] Configure Latency SLI
- [x] Configure Availability SLI
- [x] Deploy new release
- [x] Send some data
- [x] Latency SLO Violation - Find the Problem
- [x] Deploy Change to Address Latency
- [x] Error Rate SLO Violation - Find the Problem
- [x] Deploy Change to Address Error Rate
- [x] Application optimization with Stackdriver APM

## Infrastructure setup
```sh
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
gcloud container clusters list
```

## Create Stackdriver workspace
```sh
gcloud container clusters list
gcloud container clusters get-credentials shop-cluster --zone us-west1-b
kubectl get nodes
```

## Deploy application
```sh
git clone -b APM-Troubleshooting-Demo-2 https://github.com/blipzimmerman/microservices-demo-1
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64
chmod +x skaffold
sudo mv skaffold /usr/local/bin
cd microservices-demo-1
skaffold run

kubectl get pods

export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service frontend-external | awk 'BEGIN { cnt=0; } { cnt+=1; if (cnt > 1) print $4; }')
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n"  http://$EXTERNAL_IP

./setup_csr.sh
```

## Develop Sample SLOs and SLIs
## Configure Latency SLI
```
custom.googleapis.com/opencensus/grpc.io/client/roundtrip_latency
```

## Configure Availability SLI
## Deploy new release
```sh
skaffold run
kubectl get pods
```

## Send some data
## Latency SLO Violation - Find the Problem
## Deploy Change to Address Latency
```yaml
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: gcr.io/accl-19-dev/frontend:rel013019fix
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```
```sh
skaffold run
```

## Error Rate SLO Violation - Find the Problem
## Deploy Change to Address Error Rate
```yaml
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: gcr.io/accl-19-dev/frontend:rel013019fix
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```
```sh
skaffold run
```
