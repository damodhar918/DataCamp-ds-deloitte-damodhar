## Clone the Deployment Manager Sample Templates
```sh
mkdir ~/dmsamples
cd ~/dmsamples
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples.git
```

## Explore the Sample Files
```sh
cd ~/dmsamples/deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2
ls
cd nodejs/python
ls
```

## Customize the Deployment
```sh
gcloud compute zones list

nano nodejs.yaml

nano nodejs.py
```

## Run the Application
```sh
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create advanced-configuration --config nodejs.yaml
```

## Verify that the application is operational
```sh
export YOUR_IP=$(gcloud compute forwarding-rules list | awk '{print $3}' | tail -1)
http://35.243.164.47:8080
curl -k http://$YOUR_IP:8080/?msg=hello
curl -k http://$YOUR_IP:8080
```

## Create a test VM with ApacheBench
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apache2-utils
export YOUR_IP=35.243.164.47
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://$YOUR_IP:8080/
ab -n 5000 -c 100 http://$YOUR_IP:8080/
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://$YOUR_IP:8080/
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://$YOUR_IP:8080/
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://$YOUR_IP:8080/
```
