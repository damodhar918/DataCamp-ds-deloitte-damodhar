# Goal
- Reserve three public IPs for use by the NAT gateways
- Create Compute Engine instances and associate reserved IPs with them
- Create health checks and instance groups to enable automatic failure recovery
- Create routing rules to distribute traffic from guest VMs to NAT gateways
- Tag instances for no-IP
- Review a sample Debian config

# Task
