      "AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves creating algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data, reason, and make decisions or predictions. AI systems are designed to mimic human cognitive abilities, such as perception, understanding natural language, problem-solving, and even creativity. These systems can analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and adapt their behavior based on the information they receive. AI has various applications across different industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.\n"
