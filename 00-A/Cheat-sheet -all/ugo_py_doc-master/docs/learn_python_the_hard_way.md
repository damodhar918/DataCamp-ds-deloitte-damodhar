# Exercise 1, A Good First Program

<sub>shebang, begin, script</sub>

- This is a shebang (language): `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`.
- `#` is an octothorpe or pound or hash or mesh.
- Add a second line (Python version): `#! /usr/bin/env python 2`.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! /usr/bin/env python 2

print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'"
print 'I said do not touch this.'
print "testing2"
```

	Hello World!
	Hello Again
	I like typing this.
	This is fun.
	Yay! Printing.
	I'd much rather you 'not'
	I said do not touch this.
	testing2

## Shorcuts, Good to Know

- In the terminal, type `pydoc <python item>` to invoke the documentation on a python item (built-in functions, methods, objects, etc.).
- ++ctrl+c++ and/or ++ctrl+d++ break a loop.

# Exercise 3, Numbers and Math

<sub>print, format, calculate</sub>

```python
print "I will now count my chickens:"
```

	I will now count my chickens:

```python
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
# copy 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6 straight into the shell and run it
# you will get the result only (don't add print before the statement)
```

    Hens 30
    Roosters 97
    Now I will count the eggs:
    7

```python
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7"
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
```

    Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
    False

```python
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7
```

    What is 3 + 2? 5
    What is 5 - 7? -2

```python
print "Oh, that's why it's False."
print "How about some more."
```

    Oh, that's why it's False.
    How about some more.

```python
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
```

    Is it greater? True
    Is it greater or equal? True
    Is it less or equal? False

```python
print (1 + 1) # integer
```

    2

```python
print (1.0 + 1) # float
```

    2.0

# Exercise 4, Variables and Names

```python
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0 # float
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print "There are", cars, "cars available."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each cars."
```

    There are 100 cars available.
    There are only 30 drivers available.
    There will be 70 empty cars today.
    We can transport 120.0 people today.
    We have 90 to carpool today.
    We need to put about 3 in each cars.

- A constant variable, a variable that should never be altered, should be set in capital as `PI = 3.1416`.

# Exercise 5, More Variables and Printing

- Call a variable with:
	- `%r`; raw variable.
	- `%s`; string.
	- `%d`; digit.
- Make the choice depending on the variable type.
- However, if calling a 'string' (text, NLP), it must be done with `%s`; 'numbers' is done with `%r` and `%d` (possibly with `%s`). 
- The use and effects of the different calls is explained in Exercises 6 and 21.

```python
my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % my_name
```

    Let's talk about Zed A. Shaw.

```python
# does the same thing
print "He's %d years old." %my_age
print "He's", my_age,"years old."
print "He will be", my_age + 1,"years old next year."
```

    He's 35 years old.
    He's 35 years old.
    He will be 36 years old next year.
 
```python
print "He's %d inches tall." % my_height
print "He's %d pounds heavy" % my_weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (my_eyes, my_hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % my_teeth
```

    He's 74 inches tall.
    He's 180 pounds heavy
    Actually that's not too heavy.
    He's got Blue eyes and Brown hair.
    His teeth are usually White depending on the coffee.

```python
# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (
    my_age, my_height, my_weight, my_age + my_height + my_weight)
```

    If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.
    

# Exercise 6, Strings and Text

<sub>concatenate</sub>

- `%s` and `%r` help when concatenating strings.
- `%r` does not coerce the variable into a format (`%s` string or `%d` digit).


```python
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"

y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not) # assign strings or chains of strings to a variable

print x 
print y
```

    There are 10 types of people.
    Those who know binary and those who don't.

```python
print "I said: %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y
```

    I said: 'There are 10 types of people.'.
    I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'.

```python
hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"

print joke_evaluation % hilarious
```

    Isn't that joke so funny?! False

```python
# add two strings together, concatenate them
w = "This is the left side of..."
e = " a string with a right side."

# with Numpy, it would have added (mathematically speaking)
print w + e
```

    This is the left side of... a string with a right side.
    

# Exercise 15, Reading Files

- Before running this script, create a text file.
- Type `"Test file thing" > test.txt`.
- Then type `cat test.txt`.
- 'test.txt' is now saved along the other scripts.
- Run the script: `python ex15.py test.txt`
- With IPython, type: `%run ex15.py test.txt`
- Run the script without the extra argument `test.txt` to check the result.

```python
%run ex15.py test.txt
```

    Here's your file 'test.txt':
    Test file thing
    Type the filename again:
    > test.txt
    Here's your file 'test.txt' again:
    Test file thing

```python
%run ex15.py
```
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    \\Learn Python the Hard Way\ex15.py in <module>()
          1 from sys import argv
          2 
    ----> 3 script, filename = argv
          4 
          5 # similarities
    

    ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

- Load the script in IPython with `%load` to study it (don't run it!).
- This type of script requires 'external' arguments when launched: `python ex15.py test.txt`
- In the script itself, always preceed the 'external' arguments, like `filename`, with `script` since your write `python ex15.py test.txt` or `python script argument` when you launch the script.

```python
# %load ex15.py
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

# similarities between
# var = raw_input("string", digit, "prompt")
# var = open("string")

txt = open(filename) # reference to a file, not the file
print "Here's your file %r:" % filename
print txt.read()

print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ")

text_again = open(file_again)
print "Here's your file %r again:" % file_again
print text_again.read()
```

- The script again (this time, a manual import or copy-paste).

```python
from sys import argv

# always preceed the arguments like 'filename' with 'script'
script, filename = argv

# similarities
# var = raw_input("string", digit, "prompt")
# var = open("string")

txt = open(filename) #reference to a file, not the file
print "Here's your file %r:" % filename
print txt.read()

print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ")

text_again = open(file_again)
print "Here's your file %r again:" % file_again
print text_again.read()
```

- Now, use this alternative code instead.
- It does not require an external argument; the argument (`filename`) is in the script itself (it has become a variable).
- 'Internal' arguments are for functions (`def function(arg1, arg2):`); see Exercise 18.


```python
filename = "test.txt" # however, the code is limited to this file only

txt = open(filename) # reference to a file, not the file
print "Here's your file %r:" % filename
print txt.read()

print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ")

text_again = open(file_again)
print text_again.read()
```

# Exercise 16, Reading and Writing Files

<sub>open, close, readlines, truncate</sub>

- `'w'`, write, `'r'`, read, `'a'`, append.
- `'w+'`, read-write, `'r+'`, read-write, `'a+'`, read-append.
- `'r'` being the default argument, it is facultative when writing `open('file', 'r')`.
- The other arguments are mandatory; without them in `open('file, 'w')`, you cannot write, truncate, append or replace.
- First, load the script in IPython by typing `%load ex16_1.py`; it then turn to  a comment `# %load ex16_1.py`.

```python
# %load ex16.py
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?")

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w')

print "Truncating the file!"

target.truncate()

print "Now, I'm going to ask you  for three lines."

line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

target.write(line1) # 'write' variable line1
target.write("\n") # add a new line
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close()
```

- Now, run the external file in IPython (it imports the code behind the scene).
- Careful: the script requires a second argument (`filename`).

```python
%run ex16.py text.txt
```

    We're going to erase 'text.txt'.
    If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).
    If you do want that, hit RETURN.
    ?
    Opening the file...
    Truncating the file!
    Now, I'm going to ask you  for three lines.
    line 1: Good morning.
    line 2: How are you?
    line 3: I wish you a good day.
    I'm going to write these to the file.
    And finally, we close it.
    
- Read the file.

```python
filename = 'text.txt'

target = open(filename, 'r')
print target.read()
target.close()
```

    Good morning.
    How are you?
    I wish you a good day.

- Now, truncate (empty, delete, erase, clear) the file, reopen it, and to read it.

```python
filename = 'text.txt'

target = open(filename, 'w')
print "Truncating the file!"
print "-" * 25
target.truncate()
target.close()

target = open(filename, 'r')
print target.read()
target.close()
```

```text
Truncating the file!
------------------------
    
```

# Exercise 17, More Files

<sub>length, len()</sub>

- `target.read()`; read the whole file (EOF).
- `target.read(10)`; read the amount of bytes between the parentheses (1 byte = 1 character).
- `target.readline()`; read one line character at a time; the first line or the file until the first `\n`.
- `target.readline(10)`; read 10 bytes of the first line, but never more than the first line.
- `readlines()`; read in the whole file at once and splits it by line (create a list).
- `xreadlines()`; read big files.
- First, load `script ex17_1.py` in IPython. This script needs two additional arguments.

```python
# %load ex17_1.py
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists # does the file exists, T or F?

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)

in_file = open(from_file, 'r') # 'r' is facultative
indata = in_file.read() # read the content, store in memory

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata) # number of bytes in the file or length of 'indata'

print "Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file) # if the second file hasn't been created, this row will yield a 'False'

# after you run this script, if you run it again, il will yield a 'True'
print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort."
raw_input("? ")

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."

out_file.close()
in_file.close()
```

```python
%run ex17_1.py text2.txt new.txt
```

    Copying from text2.txt to new.txt
    The input file is 49 bytes long
    Does the output file exist? True
    Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort.
    ? 
    Alright, all done.

```python
target = open("text2.txt")
print target.read()
target.close()
```

    Good morning.
    How are you?
    I wish you a good day.

```python
target = open("new.txt")
print target.read()
target.close()
```

    Good morning.
    How are you?
    I wish you a good day.

```python
# %load ex17_2.py
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists # does the file exists, T or F?

script, from_file, to_file = argv

# FIRST
in_file = open(from_file, 'r')
indata = in_file.read()

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)

in_file.close()

print "-" * 25

# SECOND
checkfile = open(from_file, 'r')
print checkfile.readline() # read line 1, show
print checkfile.readline() # read line 2
print checkfile.readline() # read line 3

checkfile.close()

print "-" * 25

# THIRD
checkfile2 = open(from_file, 'r')
out_file = open(to_file, 'w')

indata = checkfile2.read()
out_file.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."

checkfile2.close()
out_file.close()

print "-" * 25

# FOURTH

checkfile3 = open(to_file, 'r')

print checkfile3.read()

checkfile3.close()
```

```python
%run ex17_2.py text2.txt new2.txt
```

    The input file is 49 bytes long
    -------------------------
    Good morning.
    
    How are you?
    
    I wish you a good day.
    -------------------------
    Alright, all done.
    -------------------------
    Good morning.
    How are you?
    I wish you a good day.
    

# Exercise 18, Names, Variables, Code, Functions

<sub>argument, flexible, indefinite</sub>

- A function can have no, one or several arguments.
    - `def function():`.
    - `def function(one)`.
    - `def function(one, two, three)`.
- `*args` means indifinite number of arguments. 
- All the arguments are is a list ('args').

```python
# indefinite
def print_two(*args):
    
    arg1, arg2 = args
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" % (arg1, arg2)

# two arguments
def print_two_again(arg1, arg2):
    
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" % (arg1, arg2)

# one argument
def print_one(arg1):
    
    print "arg1: %r" % arg1

# no arguments
def print_none():
    
    print "I got nothin'."

# indefinite
def print_two_2(*args):
    
    print "args: %r" % (args,) # much more flexible    

# two arguments
def print_two_again_2(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r, arg3: %r" % (arg1, arg2, arg3)    

# three arguments
def print_two_again_3(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r, arg3: %r" % (arg1, arg2, arg3)
    print_two("Joe", "Frank") # call a function inside a function
```

- Run the functions.

```python
print_two("Zed", "Shaw")
print_two_again("Zed", "Shaw")
```

    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw'
    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw'

```python
print_one("First!")
print_none()
```

    arg1: 'First!'
    I got nothin'.

```python
print_two_2("Zed", "Shaw", "A", "B")
```

    args: ('Zed', 'Shaw', 'A', 'B')
 
```python
print_two_again_2("Zed", "Shaw", "C")
```

    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw', arg3: 'C'

```python
print_two_again_3("Zed", "Shaw", "C")
```

    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw', arg3: 'C'
    arg1: 'Joe', arg2: 'Frank'
    

# Exercise 19, Functions and Variables

- Give different names to functions and arguments not to get confuse.

```python
def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
    
    print "You have %d cheeses!" % cheese_count
    print "You have %d boxes of crackers!" % boxes_of_crackers
    print "Man that's enough for a party!"
    print "Get a blanket. \n"
```

```python
print "1.We can just give the function numbers directly:"
cheese_and_crackers(20, 30)
```

    1.We can just give the function numbers directly:
    You have 20 cheeses!
    You have 30 boxes of crackers!
    Man that's enough for a party!
    Get a blanket. 

```python
print "2.Or, we can use variables from our script:"
amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)
```

    2.Or, we can use variables from our script:
    You have 10 cheeses!
    You have 50 boxes of crackers!
    Man that's enough for a party!
    Get a blanket. 

```python
print "3.We can even do math inside too:"
cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)
```

    3.We can even do math inside too:
    You have 30 cheeses!
    You have 11 boxes of crackers!
    Man that's enough for a party!
    Get a blanket. 
 
```python
print "4.And we can combine the two, variables and math:"
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese + 100, amount_of_crackers + 1000)
```

    4.And we can combine the two, variables and math:
    You have 110 cheeses!
    You have 1050 boxes of crackers!
    Man that's enough for a party!
    Get a blanket. 

```python
print "5.Make a GUI."
print "Enter the amount of cheese:",
amount_of_cheese = int(raw_input())
amount_of_crackers = int(raw_input("Enter the amount of crackers: "))
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)
```

    5.Make a GUI.
    Enter the amount of cheese:2
    Enter the amount of crackers: 5
     You have 2 cheeses!
    You have 5 boxes of crackers!
    Man that's enough for a party!

# Exercise 21, Functions Can Return Something or not...

<sub>integer, float, int, coerce, digit, string, raw</sub>

- `%r` for raw.
- `%d` for digit.
- `%s` for string.
- `int()` with `%d` = integer.
- `int()` with `%r` or `%s` = integer.
- `float()` with `%d` = integer.
- `float()`  with `%r` or `%s` = float.
- `%r` is a safer choice; see below.

```python

# Exercise 25, Even More Practice

<sub>import, module, package, script, library</sub>

- For this exercice, consult the manual.
- First, run python ex25.py to find out any errors.
- Second, use the python engine to run pieces of codes from this file and not just trigger the whole code from this file
- Check out file `25_1.txt`.

```python
# %load ex25.py
def break_words(stuff):
    
    """This function will break up words for us."""
    words = stuff.split(' ') # the method splits the characters each time it finds a 'space'
    return words # you must specify in python where to load the result (into 'words')
    
def sort_words(words):
    
    """Sorts the words."""
    return sorted(words) # the python function sorts the separated words

def print_first_word(words):
    
    """Prints the first word after popping in off."""
    word = words.pop(0) # the method returns the first word in the index (position 0)
    print word

def print_last_word(words):
    
    """Prints the last word after popping it off."""
    word = words.pop(-1) # the method returns the last word in the index (position -1)
    print word

def sort_sentence(sentence):
    
    """Takes in a full sentence and returns the sorted words."""
    words = break_words(sentence) # launch a function
    return sort_words(words) # launch another function with the result of the first function

def print_first_and_last(sentence):
    
    """Prints the first and last words of the sentence."""
    words = break_words(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)
    
def print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence):
    
    """Sorts the words then prints the first and last one."""
    words = sort_sentence(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)
```

```python
%run ex25.py
```

- In the next script, you `import` the above script (ex25.py) as an external module (even though the script was previously run in IPython, and we want to simulate a script importing another script) and use its function as methods.

```python
import ex25

sentence = "All good things come to those who wait."

words = ex25.break_words(sentence)
words
```

    ['All', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'to', 'those', 'who', 'wait.']

```python
sorted_words = ex25.sort_words(words)
sorted_words
```

    ['All', 'come', 'good', 'things', 'those', 'to', 'wait.', 'who']

```python
ex25.print_first_word(words)
ex25.print_last_word(words)

```

    All
    wait.
    ['good', 'things', 'come', 'to', 'those', 'who']




```python

# Exercise 32, Loops and Lists

<sub>for, loop, list</sub>

```python
the_count = [1,2,3,4,5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
for number in the_count:
    print "\tThis is count %d" % number
```

    	This is count 1
    	This is count 2
    	This is count 3
    	This is count 4
    	This is count 5

```python
# same as above
for fruit in fruits:
    print "A fruit of type: %s" % fruit
```

    A fruit of type: apples
    A fruit of type: oranges
    A fruit of type: pears
    A fruit of type: apricots

- We can go though mixed lists too. Notice we have to use `%r` since we don't know what's in it.

```python
for i in change:
    print "\tI got %r" % i
```

    	I got 1
    	I got 'pennies'
    	I got 2
    	I got 'dimes'
    	I got 3
    	I got 'quarters'

- We can also build lists. First, start with an empty one.

```python
elements = []

# then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
# 0 means 1st, the 6th is excluded; 0,1,2,3,4,5
for i in range(0, 6):
    print "Adding %d to the list." % i
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i) # elements is a variable to which we add numbers
```

    Adding 0 to the list.
    Adding 1 to the list.
    Adding 2 to the list.
    Adding 3 to the list.
    Adding 4 to the list.
    Adding 5 to the list.

- We can print them out.

```python
for i in elements:
    print "\tElement was: %d" % i  
```

    	Element was: 0
    	Element was: 1
    	Element was: 2
    	Element was: 3
    	Element was: 4
    	Element was: 5
 
```python
print "Test the range function..."
print "range(5):", range(5)
print "range(6):", range(6)
print "range(1, 5):", range(1, 5)
print "range(2, 5):", range(2, 5)
print "range(0, 10, 2):", range(0, 10, 2)
```

    Test the range function...
    range(5): [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(6): [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    range(1, 5): [1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(2, 5): [2, 3, 4]
    range(0, 10, 2): [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

- Two-dimentional lists (above 2 dimension, it can become memory-intensive to compute!).

<sub>2d, tabular, lists in list, list of lists</sub>

```python
the_count_two = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]

# this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
# this list is not numerical, use %r or %s
for number in the_count_two:
    print "\tThis is count %r" % number
```

	This is count [1, 2, 3]
 	This is count [4, 5, 6]

# Exercise 33, While Loops

<sub>while, loop</sub>

```python
i = 0
numbers = []

while i < 6:
    print "At the top i is %d" % i
    numbers.append(i)
    
    i += 1
    print "Number now: ", numbers
    print "At the botton i is %d" % i


print "The numbers: "
```

    At the top i is 0
    Number now:  [0]
    At the botton i is 1
    At the top i is 1

- Make it a function.

```python
def breaking_list(max_of, increm):
    
    i = 0
    numbers = []

    while i < max_of:
        print "At the top i is %d" % i

        i += increm
        print "Number now: ", numbers
        print "At the botton i is %d" % i

    print "The numbers: "

    for num in numbers:
        print num
        
print "Enter an integer, a maximum, higher than 1."
max_integer = int(raw_input("> "))
print "Enter an integer, an increment, equal or more than 1"
increment = int(raw_input("> "))
print "The maximum is %d and the increment is %d" % (max_integer, increment)

breaking_list(max_integer, increment)
```

    Enter an integer, a maximum, higher than 1.
    > 5
    Enter an integer, an increment, equal or more than 1
    > 2
    The maximum is 5 and the increment is 2
    At the top i is 0
    Number now:  [0]
    At the botton i is 2
    At the top i is 2
    Number now:  [0, 2]

    more_stuff: ['Day', 'Night', 'Song', 'Frisbee', 'Corn', 'Banana', 'Girl', 'Boy'] , a list

- Most of the time, a for-loop is better than a while-loop.
- A while-loop is better when there is a test, a condition.

```python
while len(stuff) != 10:
    next_one = more_stuff.pop() # load a variable with another variable, method pop, pop means extracting 1 item from a list variable, the last item in the list
    print "Adding: ", next_one # show the content
    stuff.append(next_one) # variable stuff add 1-item list variable; the loop will go as long as stuff has less than 10 items  
    print "stuff:", stuff
    print "There are %d items now." % len(stuff) # length of stuff or the number of items in it

print "There we go: ", stuff
```

    Adding:  Boy
    stuff: ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Crows', 'Telephones', 'Light', 'Sugar', 'Boy']
    There are 7 items now.
    Adding:  Girl
    stuff: ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Crows', 'Telephones', 'Light', 'Sugar', 'Boy', 'Girl']
    There are 8 items now.
    Adding:  Banana
    stuff: ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Crows', 'Telephones', 'Light', 'Sugar', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Banana']
    There are 9 items now.
    Adding:  Corn
    stuff: ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Crows', 'Telephones', 'Light', 'Sugar', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Banana', 'Corn']
    There are 10 items now.
    There we go:  ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Crows', 'Telephones', 'Light', 'Sugar', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Banana', 'Corn']
 
```python
print "Let's do some things with stuff."

# print and pop choosen items according to the index
# could also be random index values!!!
# could reorder the list before (ascending, descending) 
print stuff[1] # the 2nd item
print stuff[2] # the 3rd item
print stuff[-1] # the last item
print stuff[-2]
print stuff.pop() # pop the last item
print stuff.pop(0) # pop the first item
print stuff.pop(1) # pop the 2nd item
print stuff.pop(-1) # pop the last item
print ' '.join(stuff) # var.split(' ') vs ' '.join(var), concatenate the list
print '#'.join(stuff[3:5]) # add a character at position 3 and 4 (4th, 5th, excluding the last) 
```

# Exercise 39, Dictionaries, Oh Lovely Dictionaries

<sub>dictionary</sub>

```python
things = ['a','b','c','d'] # list

print things
print things[1]
```

    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    b

- Change an element.

```python
things[1] = 'z'
print things
```

    ['a', 'z', 'c', 'd']
    

- A dictionary has keys associated with values. 
- Order does not matter. 
- If you supply the key, you will get the value.


```python
stuff = {'name' : 'Zed','age' : '39','height' : 8 * 12 + 2} # a dictionary

print stuff
print stuff['name']
print stuff['age']
print stuff['height']
```

    {'age': '39', 'name': 'Zed', 'height': 98}
    Zed
    39
    98
    

- Add an element.


```python
stuff['city'] = "San Francisco"
print stuff['city']
print stuff
```

    San Francisco
    {'city': 'San Francisco', 'age': '39', 'name': 'Zed', 'height': 98}
    

- Add and remove an element.


```python
stuff['color'] = "blue"
print stuff

del stuff['color']
print stuff
```

    {'color': 'blue', 'city': 'San Francisco', 'age': '39', 'name': 'Zed', 'height': 98}
    {'city': 'San Francisco', 'age': '39', 'name': 'Zed', 'height': 98}
    

- If the value does not exist when you call it, it will turn out an error. Instead, write it this way: `print "%r" % stuff.get('color',None)`. 
- If it's not existant, it will return 'None' or a value by default

```python
print stuff['state']
```
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-69-f211ffe8fe02> in <module>()
    ----> 1 print stuff['state']
    

    KeyError: 'state'

```python
print "%r" % stuff.get('color', None)
```

    None

- Change an element.

```python
print stuff['age']

stuff['age'] = 400
print stuff['age']
```

    39
    400

- Extract with the index.

```python
stuff[1] = "Wow"
stuff[2] = "Neato"
print stuff[1]
print stuff[2]

print stuff # new items won't be in order
```

    Wow
    Neato
    {'city': 'San Francisco', 2: 'Neato', 'name': 'Zed', 1: 'Wow', 'age': 400, 'height': 98}

- Delete an element (according to the index).

```python
del stuff[1]
del stuff[2]

print stuff
```

    {'city': 'San Francisco', 'name': 'Zed', 'age': 400, 'height': 98}

- Create a mapping of state to abbreviation.


```python
states = {
    'Oregon': 'OR',
    'Florida': 'FL',
    'California': 'CA',
    'New York': 'NY',
    'Michigan': 'MI'
}
```

- Create a basic set of states and some cities in them.

```python
cities = {
    'CA': 'San Francisco',
    'MI': 'Detroit',
    'FL': 'Jacksonville'
}
```

- Add some key:value to dictionary cities.

```python
cities['NY'] = 'New York'
cities['OR'] = 'Portland'
```

- Print out some cities.

```python
print "Dictionary 'cities': ", cities
print '-' * 10
print "NY State has: ", cities['NY'] # call the key
print "OR State has: ", cities['OR'] # get the value
```

    Dictionary 'cities':  {'FL': 'Jacksonville', 'CA': 'San Francisco', 'MI': 'Detroit', 'OR': 'Portland', 'NY': 'New York'}
    ----------
    NY State has:  New York
    OR State has:  Portland

- Print some states.

```python
print "Dictionary 'states': ", states
print '-' * 10
print "Michigan's abbreviation is: ", states['Michigan']
print "Florida's abbrebiation is: ", states['Florida']
```

    Dictionary 'states':  {'California': 'CA', 'Michigan': 'MI', 'New York': 'NY', 'Florida': 'FL', 'Oregon': 'OR'}
    ----------
    Michigan's abbreviation is:  MI
    Florida's abbrebiation is:  FL

- Print a dictionary in dictionary.

```python
print "Michigan has: ", cities[states['Michigan']]
# is like states['Michigan'], then cities['MI']
print "florida has: ", cities[states['Florida']]
```

    Michigan has:  Detroit
    florida has:  Jacksonville

- Print every state abbreviation.

```python
print "Enumerate Dictionary 'states', key:value..."
for state, abbrev in states.items():
    print "%s is abbreviated %s" % (state, abbrev)
# state = 1st item = key, abbrev = 2nd item = value
```

    Enumerate Dictionary 'states', key:value...
    California is abbreviated CA
    Michigan is abbreviated MI
    New York is abbreviated NY
    Florida is abbreviated FL
    Oregon is abbreviated OR

- Print every city in state.

```python
print "Enumerate Dictionary 'cities', key:value..."
for abbrev, city in cities.items():
    print "%s has the city %s" % (abbrev, city)   
```

    Enumerate Dictionary 'cities', key:value...
    FL has the city Jacksonville
    CA has the city San Francisco
    MI has the city Detroit
    OR has the city Portland
    NY has the city New York

- Now do both at the same time.

```python
print "Enumerate both dictionaries..."
for state, abbrev in states.items():
    print "%s state is abbreviated %s and has city %s" % (state, abbrev, cities[abbrev])
# state California gives abbrev CA, inside cities gives San Francisco   
```

    Enumerate both dictionaries...
    California state is abbreviated CA and has city San Francisco
    Michigan state is abbreviated MI and has city Detroit
    New York state is abbreviated NY and has city New York
    Florida state is abbreviated FL and has city Jacksonville
    Oregon state is abbreviated OR and has city Portland

- `get()` seek a key, whether it exists or not.

```python
state = states.get('Texas') # extract

if not state:
    print "Sorry, no Texas."
```

    Sorry, no Texas.

- Get a city with a default value.

```python
city = cities.get('TX', 'Does Not Exist')
print "The city for the state 'TX' is: %s" % city
```

    The city for the state 'TX' is: Does Not Exist

- Let's step up the above operations.
- Module `hashmap.py` works through a dictionary. 
- Module `ex39_test.py` contains dictionaries (just like the above).
- In Python, we would run module `ex39_test.py`. 
- The module would begin by importing module `hashmap.py` to use its methods and perform operations.
- Consult the manual.

# Exercise 40, Modules, Classes, and Objects

```python
mystuff = {'apple': 'I AM APPLES'}

print mystuff['apple'] # get X from Y
```

    I AM APPLES
 
- You can import a file with functions and variables from a another module.
- You can access the functions (methods) and variables from this other module.
- Both files must be in the same directory, otherwise, specify the path as well.

```python
# %load ex40.py
def apple():
    
    print "I AM APPLES!"

# this is just a variable
tangerine = "Living reflection of a dream"

apple()
```

```python
%run ex40.py
```

    I AM APPLES!

```python
import ex40

ex40.apple()

print ex40.tangerine
```

    I AM APPLES!
    Living reflection of a dream

```python
mystuff['new'] = ex40.tangerine

print mystuff['new']
```

    Living reflection of a dream

```python
import ex40

thing = ex40

thing.apple()
print thing.tangerine
```

    I AM APPLES!
    I AM APPLES!
    Living reflection of a dream

- Use a class instead of an imported module.
- Remember: class method = class function.

```python
class Song(object):

    
    def __init__(self, lyrics): # instantiation and shortcut for a creating a variable
        self.lyrics = lyrics # the variable could be equal to a text, a number or a variable

    def sing_me_a_song(self): # create a class function
        for line in self.lyrics:
            print line

            
# instance            
happy_bday = Song(["Happy birthday to you",
                   "I don't want to get sued",
                   "So I'll stop right there"])

# instance
bulls_on_parade = Song(["They rally around tha family",
                        "With pockets full of shells"])

# instance
au_clair = Song(["Au clair de la lune",
                 "Mon ami Pierrot",
                 "Prete-moi ta plume",
                 "Pour ecrire un mot"])

# not an instance!!!
frere_jacques = ["Frere Jacques (bis)",
                 "Dormez-vous (bis)",
                 "Sonnez les matines (bis)",
                 "Ding-din-don (bis)"]

# instance
frere = Song(["Frere Jacques (bis)",
              "Dormez-vous (bis)",
              "Sonnez les matines (bis)",
              "Ding-din-don (bis)"])


# not a class function
def chante_moi(paroles): # create a function
    
    for ligne in paroles:
        print ligne
```

- Invoke an instance.

```python
happy_bday.sing_me_a_song()
```

    Happy birthday to you
    I don't want to get sued
    So I'll stop right there
    
- Again.

```python
bulls_on_parade.sing_me_a_song()
```

    They rally around tha family
    With pockets full of shells
    

Write `instance.class function`/`instance.class method`

```python
au_clair.sing_me_a_song()
```

    Au clair de la lune
    Mon ami Pierrot
    Prete-moi ta plume
    Pour ecrire un mot
    
- Write the method the other around: `Class.class_function()`/`Class.class_method()`.

```python
#au_clair.sing_me_a_song()
Song.sing_me_a_song(au_clair)
```

    Au clair de la lune
    Mon ami Pierrot
    Prete-moi ta plume
    Pour ecrire un mot

- This function is independent.
- `frere_jacques.chante_moi()` can't be!!!

```python
chante_moi(frere_jacques)
```

    Frere Jacques (bis)
    Dormez-vous (bis)
    Sonnez les matines (bis)
    Ding-din-don (bis)
    
- It looks like `Class.class_function()`/`Class.class_method()`

```python
Song.sing_me_a_song(frere)
```

    Frere Jacques (bis)
    Dormez-vous (bis)
    Sonnez les matines (bis)
    Ding-din-don (bis)
    

# Exercise 41, Learning to Speak Object-Oriented

- Sample of the original word list, 10 out of 503:

	    text
	    account
	    achiever
	    actor
	    addition
	    adjustment
	    advertisement
	    advice
	    aftermath
	    agreement
	    airplane

- Same script, but the list of word comes  from the Internet.
- A note on the script:
	- The use of constant variable such as WORD_URL (such variable should not be modified).
	- A constant variable can be anything from a number, a string to a dictionary.
	- The use of `try/except` pair to check for errors. It is similar to the pair `if/else`.
	- Therea are several types of errors. `EOFError` is just one type. Consult other (or online) manuals to find out about all the types of errors.

- The concept of inheritance, and those of implicit inheritance, overridden inheritance, multiple inheritance, composition, alteration, super objects (or 'reinheritance') are explained in Exercise 44.

# Exercise 43, Gothons from Planet Percal #25

This Exercise is the first to prepare the final project (Exercise 52, the last chapter). Let's create a game, from A to Z. First, start by planning. This methodology is valuable for planning any kind of project or program.

Methodology

1- Write about the problem:

"Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map."

2- Describe each scene:

- Death
    - This is when the player dies and should be something funny.
- Central Corridor
    - This is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing there they have to defeat with a joke before continuing.
- Laser Weapon Armory
    - This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting to the escape pod. It has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.
- The Bridge
    - Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.
- Escape Pod
    - Where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod. 


3- Draw a map, write more descriptions.


4- Extract key concepts:


- 1 concept = 1 class.
- Research them, deepen things.
- Nouns = concepts = classes:
    - Alien
    - Player
    - Ship
    - Maze
    - Room
    - Scene
    - Gothon
    - Escape Pod
    - Planet
    - Map
    - Engine
    - Death
    - Central Corridor
    - Laser Weapon Armory
    - The Bridge
- Verbs = functions.

This is par the PEP: classes should be in an explicit noun startin with a uppercased letter such as `class Central Corridor()`. Functions should be verbs such as `def play():`.

5- Create a class Hierarchy and object Map

- Make a class Hierarchy:
- Map
- Engine
- Scene
    - Death
    - Central Corridor
    - Laser Weapon Armory
    - The Bridge
    - Escape Pod
  
PEP: I know from the description I'm going to need a way to 'run' the engine, 'get the next scene' from the map, get the 'opening scene', and 'enter' a scene. I'll add those like this:

- Map
  - next_scene
  - opening_scene
- Engine
  - play
- Scene
  - enter
  - Death
  - Central Corridor
  - Laser Weapon Armory
  - The Bridge
  - Escape Pod

All the scenes under another scene will inherit it; except 'enter': override it later.

6- Code the Classes and a Test to Run Them:

- Turn:

```
- Map
    - next_scene (verb)
    - opening scene (verb)
- Engine
    - play (verb)
- Scene
    - enter (verb)
    - Death
    - Central Corridor
    - Laser Weapon Armory
    - The Bridge
    - Escape Pod
```

- Into:

```
class Map(object): 
    def __init__(self, start_scene):
    def next_scene(self, start_scene):    
    def opening_scene(self):

class Engine(object): 
    def __init__(self, scene_map):
    def play(self):

class Scene(object):
    def enter(self):

    class CentralCorridor(Scene):
        def enter(self):
    class LaserWeaponArmory(Scene):
        def enter(self):
    class TheBridge(Scene):
        def enter(self):
    class EscapePod(Scene):
        def enter(self):
    class Death(Scene):
        def enter(self):

a_map = Map('central_corridor')
a_game = Engine(a_map)
a_game.play()
```

- Into:

```
class Scene(object):

    def enter(self):
        pass


class Engine(object):

    def __init__(self, scene_map):
        pass
    def play(self):
        pass
        
        
class Death(Scene):

    def enter(self):
        pass


class CentralCorridor(Scene):

    def enter(self):
        pass
        

    def enter(self):
        pass
 
        
class TheBridge(Scene):
    def enter(self):
        pass


class EscapePod(Scene):

    def enter(self):
        pass


class Map(object):

    def __init__(self, start_scene):
        pass
    def next_scene(self, scene_name):
        pass
    def opening_scene(self):
        pass


a_map = Map('central_corridor')
a_game = Engine(a_map)
a_game.play()
```

- Start coding (first code skeleton).

```python
class Scene(object):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass

class Engine(object):
    
    
    def __init__(self, scene_map):
        
        pass
    
    def play(self):
        
        pass

    
class Death(Scene):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass

    
class CentralCorridor(Scene):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass

    
class LaserWeaponArmory(Scene):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass


class TheBridge(Scene):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass


class EscapePod(Scene):
    
    
    def enter(self):
        
        pass


class Map(object):
    
    
    def __init__(self, start_scene):
        
        pass
    
    def next_scene(self, scene_name):
        
        pass
    
    def opening_scene(self):
        
        pass


a_map = Map('central_corridor')
a_game = Engine(a_map)
a_game.play()
```

# Exercise 44, Inheritance vs Composition

From the manual.

## When to Use Inheritance or Composition

The question of 'inheritance versus composition' comes down to an attempt to solve the problem of reusable code. 

You don't want to have duplicated code all over your software, since that's not clean and efficient. 

- Inheritance: solves this problem by creating a mechanism for you to have implied features in base classes.
- Composition: solves this by giving you modules and the ability to call functions in other classes.

If both solutions solve the problem of reuse, then which one is appropriate in which situations? The answer is incredibly subjective, but I'll give you my three guidelines for when to do which:

1. Avoid multiple Inheritance at all costs, as it's too complex to be reliable. If you're stuck with it, then be prepared to know the class hierarchy and spend time finding where everything is coming from.
2. Use Composition to package code into modules that are used in many different unrelated places and situations.
3. Use Inheritance only when there are clearly related reusable pieces of code that fit under a single common concept or if you have to because of something you're using.

The thing to remember about object-oriented programming is that it is entirely a social convention programmers have created to package and share code. In that case, find out how they use things and then just adapt to the situation.

## Function Style

<sub>pep</sub>

Function = Method.

A class does things: name it as if it's a command you are giving to the class. Same as `pop` is saying 'pop this off the list'.

Keep functions small and simple (PEP).

Class Style

- Use the camel case: `SuperGoldFactory`.
- Minimize what `__init__` does. It should be simple to use.
- Other class functions use the underscore format: `my_awesome_hair`.
- Be consistent in how you organize your function arguments. Function 1 takes `(dog, cat, user)`, function 2 should take `(dog, cat, user)`. Unless there is a good reason.
- Variable should be self-contained. Limit importing from modules or globals.
- Always have a class `Name(object)` on top of all.

Code Style

- Give your code vertical space to read.
- Read you code out loud to test it. Change the difficult passages to improve readibility.
- Imitate other coders: find you style.
- Respect others's style; be a team player.

Good Comments

- Describe why you are doing doing what you are doing.
- Write for the others.
- Write sentences.
- Avoid clutering the code though. Short sentences, to the point.
- Review your comments.

## Composition

In this code I'm not using the name Parent, since there is not a parent-child is-a relationship. This is a has-a relationship, where Child has-a Other that it uses to get its work done. 

```python
class Other(object):

    def implicit(self):
        
        print "OTHER implicit()"

    def override(self):
        
        print "OTHER override()"

    def altered(self):
        
        print "OTHER altered()"

        
class Child(object):

    def __init__(self):
        
        self.other = Other() # initialize this class with Other(), when an instance is created, it will inherit the class member variables, class functions...

    def implicit(self):
        
        self.other.implicit() # call the other class function 

    def override(self):
        
        print "CHILD override()"

    def altered(self):
        
        print "CHILD, BEFORE OTHER altered()"
        self.other.altered() # call the other class function
        print "CHILD, AFTER OTHER altered()"

        
son = Child() # instance

son.implicit()
son.override()
son.altered()
```

## Implicit Inheritance

Actions on the child imply an action on the parent.

The use of pass under the `class Child:` is how you tell Python that you want an empty block. This creates a class named `Child` but says that there's nothing new to define in it. Instead it will inherit all of its behavior from `Parent`.

If you put functions in a base class (i.e., `Parent`) then all subclasses (i.e., `Child`) will automatically get those features. Very handy for repetitive code you need in many classes.

```python
class Parent(object):

    def implicit(self):
        
        print "PARENT implicit()"

        
class Child(Parent):
    
    pass


dad = Parent()
son = Child()
```

## Inherit from both Classes

Python has to look-up the possible function in the class hierarchy for both `Child` and `BadStuff`, but it needs to do this in a consistent order. To do this Python uses "method resolution order" (MRO) and an algorithm called C3 to get it straight.

Because the MRO is complex and a well-defined algorithm is used, Python can't leave it to you to get the MRO right. Instead, Python gives you the `super()` function, which handles all of this for you in the places that you need the altering type of actions as I did in Child.altered. With `super()` you don't have to worry about getting this right, and Python will find the right function for you.

```python
class SuperFun(Child, BadStuff):
    
    pass
```

## Override Explicitly

Actions on the child override the action on the parent.

As you can see, it runs the `Parent.override` function because that variable (dad) is a Parent. But it also runs  `Child.override` messages because son is an instance of `Child` and `Child` overrides that function by defining its own version.

```python
class Parent(object):

    def override(self):
        print "PARENT override()"

        
class Child(Parent):

    def override(self):
        
        print "CHILD override()"

        
dad = Parent()
son = Child()

dad.override()
son.override()
```

## Alter Before or After

Actions on the child alter the action on the parent.

`son.altered()` overrides Parent.altered the `Child.altered` version runs, and line 9 executes like you'd expect. In this case I want to do a before and after, I want to use super to get the `Parent.altered` version. I call `super(Child, self).altered()`, which is aware of inheritance and will get the `Parent` class for you. You should be able to read this as "call super with arguments `Child` and `self`, then call the function altered on whatever it returns." At this point, the `Parent.altered` version of the function runs, and that prints out the Parent message. Finally, this returns from the `Parent.altered` and the `Child.altered` function continues to print out the after message.

```python
class Parent(object):

    def altered(self):
        
        print "PARENT altered()"

class Child(Parent):
   
    def altered(self):
        
        print "CHILD, BEFORE PARENT altered()"
        super(Child, self).altered()
        print "CHILD, AFTER PARENT altered()"

        
dad = Parent()
son = Child()

dad.altered()
son.altered()
```

## Super

With `super`, `Child` reinherit from the `Parent`.

The most common use of `super()` is actually in `__init__` functions in base classes. Then additional class functions.

```python
class Child(Parent):

    def __init__(self, stuff):
        
        self.stuff = stuff
        super(Child, self).__init__()
```

## All Three Combined

```python
class Parent(object):
    
    def override(self):
        
        print "PARENT override()"

    def implicit(self):
        
        print "PARENT implicit()"

    def altered(self):
        
        print "PARENT altered()"

        
class Child(Parent):
   
    def override(self):
        
        print "CHILD override()"

    def altered(self):
        
        print "CHILD, BEFORE PARENT altered()"
        super(Child, self).altered()
        print "CHILD, AFTER PARENT altered()"

        
dad = Parent()
son = Child()

dad.implicit()
son.implicit()

dad.override()
son.override()

dad.altered()
son.altered()
```

# Exercise 46, A Project Skeleton

- The 'skeleton' directory (see below) or the directory framework will have all the basics you need to get a new project up and running. 
- It will have your project layout, automated tests, modules, and install scripts.

```
\:.
├───bin
│   ├───__init__.py
│   └───__init__.pyc
├───docs
├───NAME
│   ├───__init__.py
│   └───__init__.pyc
├───tests
│   ├───__init__.py
│   └───__init__.pyc
└───setup.py   
```

- `\:.` is the project parent directory or simply 'the' directory (its name is the project's name).
- The directory is the place to be when launching scripts.
- `bin` is the main sub-directory. It contains the main script (`python bin/main.py`) for launching other scripts in the project; and launching tests as well. These script are often located in other sub-directories.
- A sub-directory must be executable to import a module from it or execute a script in it: add an empty script called `__init__.py`.
- When a script is executed, it is compiled. Another script, with the extension `.pyc`, appears. Same as for `__init__.pyc`, as the sub-directory was executed (when a script import a script from another sub-directory for example).
- `tests` contains files to perform nose tests and unittests.
- `setup.py` is for documenting and distributing the project (when the project is compiled to be launched as a whole or frozen to be distributed).
- You can add a `readme` file below (usually a text or markdown document).
- The `docs` sub-directory contains all the project's documentation. It is more elaborate than the 'readme' file: manuals, explanations, logs, wikis, etc.
- There can be other sub-directories for static such as images, web languages, etc.
- Repeat this directory structure for every project.
- To clean up the directory, in the bash:

```bash
find . -name "*.pyc" -print #display
find . -name "*.pyc" -exec rn{}\; 1 remove

grep -r "NAME" * #search within files
```

- In Linux, before running any script, be sure to set the path to the project directory. 
- Bash:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD

unset PYTHONPATH # to remove
```

- In Windows, set the path in the environment variables. Otherwise, Python won't find the scripts.
- PowerShell:

```bash
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$env:PYTHONPATH;."
```

- Or, on top of the Python code, below the shebang lnes, and before any other imports, add:

```python
import sys
sys.path # to view
sys.path.append('.') # to set
```

- Consult the manual to find out more.

# Exercise 47, Automated Testing

## Miscellaneous notes

- The project directory is 'ex47'.
- Test if you migrated the files correctly. In the bash:

```bash
grep -r NAME *  # no traces of 'NAME', from 'skeleton'
find . -name "*.pyc" -exec rm {} \; # no trace of 'name'
```

- When you launch a script, you launch it from the parent directory with `python bin/app.py`.
- In directory 'ex47', run tests with `python tests/BLAH_tests.py`. 
- Consult the manual about testing. This is not covered in this notebook. 
- Testing must be done in the shell or in the bash. Make sure you're running the tests with nosetests not with just Python. 
- The important functions here are `assert_equal` which makes sure that variables you have set or paths you have built in a Room are actually what you think they are. If you get the wrong result, then nosetests will print out an error message so you can go figure it out.
- In a script, when you import from another sub-directory, code:

```python
from ex47.game import Room
```

- When the imported script is in the same sub-directory, code:

```python
from bin import Room
```

- Consult the manual to find out more.
