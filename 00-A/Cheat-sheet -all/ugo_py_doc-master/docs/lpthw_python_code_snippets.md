# A Gradebook for Students

<sub>students, marks, grades, compute, average, weighted</sub>

First, create 3 dictionaries.

Second, add names, marks.

```python
lloyd = {
    "name" : "Lloyd",
    "homework" : [90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0],
    "quizzes" : [88.0, 40.0, 94.0],
    "tests" : [75.0, 90.0]
}

alice = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "homework" : [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
    "quizzes" : [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
    "tests" : [89.0, 97.0]
}

tyler = {
    "name" : "Tyler",
    "homework" : [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
    "quizzes" : [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
    "tests" : [100.0, 100.0]
}
```

Third, make a list.

```python
students= [lloyd, alice, tyler]

cases = ["homework", "quizzes", "tests"]

w_calc = [0.10, 0.30, 0.60]

all_average = 0.0
```

Print out.


```python
print "\nStudents' Grades".upper()

print ""

for student in students:
    print student["name"].upper()
    print "Homework"
    print student["homework"]
    print "Quizzes"
    print student["quizzes"]
    print "Tests"
    print student["tests"]
    print ""
```

Compute averages.

```python
def average(numbers):
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    temp = float(total) / len(numbers)
    return temp

print "Students' Averages".upper()

print ""

for c in cases:

        calc = round(average(numbers),1)
        print student["name"]
        print calc
    print ""
```

Compute weighted averages.


```python
def w_average(marks):
    
    #w_calc = [0.10, 0.30, 0.60]
    s_calc = 0
    w = 0
    while w < len(w_calc):
        s_calc += w_calc[w] * marks[w]

        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

def get_class_average(ind):
    class_total = round(ind / len(students), 1)
    return class_total

print "Students' Weighted Average".upper()

print " Ponderation [Homeworks, Quizzes, Tests]: ["+str(float(w_calc[0])*100)+", "+str(float(w_calc[1])*100)+", "+str(float(w_calc[2])*100)+"]"

print ""

for student in students:
    print(student["name"] + "'s marks are:").upper()
    l_calc = []
    for c in cases:    
        numbers = student[c]
        calc = round(average(numbers),1)
        l_calc.append(calc)
    print l_calc
    print("For a weighted average of:")
    ind_average = round(w_average(l_calc),1)
    print ind_average
    print("Standing for a:")
    print get_letter_grade(ind_average)
    all_average += ind_average
    print ""

print("Finally, The class average is:").upper()
print get_class_average(all_average)
```

# Guess Games

<sub>random, generate, number, conditional, if, else, ifel, loop</sub>

Guess a number.

```python
import random

print "Lucky Numbers! 3 numbers will be generated."
print "If one of them is a '5', you lose!"

count = 0

while count < 3:
    num = random.randint(1, 6)

    if num == 5:
        print "Sorry, you lose!"
        break

Guess a number (more).

```python

With respect to S3 and S4 classes, the S3 class is more flexible, and the S4 class is a more structured approach. This is a nice way of saying that the S3 class approach is for unaware slobs and is a sloppy way to shoot yourself in the foot, while the S4 class is for uptight pedants. Our focus here is on S3 classes. Before we delve into the details of S3 classes we need to talk about memory environments. These can be used to great effect in S3 classes to make your codes totally incomprehensible. On the down side they help give S3 classes their flexibility. An environment can be thought of as a local scope. It has a set of variables associated with it. You can access those variables if you have the \"ID\" associated with the environment. There are a number of commands you can use to manipulate and obtain the pointers to your environments. You can also use the assign and get commands to set and get the values of variables within an environment.")
