    "# To use this as a classification algorithm, all you have to do is assign a cutoff point to these probabilities. If the predicted probability is above the cutoff point, you classify that observation as a 'yes' (in this case, the flight being late), if it's below, you classify it as a 'no'!\n",

A hyperparameter is just a value in the model that's not estimated from the data, but rather is supplied by the user to maximize performance. For this course it's not necessary to understand the mathematics behind all of these values - what's important is that you'll try out a few different choices and pick the best one."

Once the data is split up, one of the partitions is set aside, and the model is fit to the others. Then the error is measured against the held out partition. This is repeated for each of the partitions, so that every block of data is held out and used as a test set exactly once. Then the error on each of the partitions is averaged. This is called the cross validation error of the model, and is a good estimate of the actual error on the held out data.\n",
