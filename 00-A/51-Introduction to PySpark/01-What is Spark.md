Oops, it looks like there was a mix-up in the question. The question was about generating an MD file for Hive developer for quick review with examples. Here's an example of an MD file for a brief Hive review:

# Hive Developer Quick Review

Hive is a data warehousing solution for Hadoop that enables data summarization, querying, and analysis of large datasets. It provides a SQL-like language called HiveQL, which allows developers to write SQL-like queries and transform them into MapReduce jobs.

## HiveQL Basics

HiveQL is similar to SQL, but with some differences. Here are some basic concepts and examples:

### Creating Tables

To create a new table in Hive:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1_name data_type,
  column2_name data_type,
  ...
);
```

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT,
  salary DOUBLE
);
```

### Loading Data

To load data into a table:

```
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'file_path' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

Example:

```
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/user/data/employee.csv' INTO TABLE employee;
```

### Querying Data

To query data from a table:

```
SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
```

Example:

```
SELECT name, age, salary
FROM employee
WHERE age > 30
```

## Hive Advanced Features

Hive also provides some advanced features and optimizations, such as partitioning, buckets, and indexing.

### Partitioning

Partitioning is a way to divide a table into smaller, manageable parts based on specific columns. It improves query performance by allowing Hive to skip over partitions that don't satisfy certain conditions.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT,
  salary DOUBLE
)
PARTITIONED BY (country STRING);

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/user/data/employee.csv' INTO TABLE employee
PARTITION (country='USA');
```

### Buckets

Buckets is a way to group data within a partition based on a hash function of one or more columns. It improves query performance by reducing the number of data that needs to be scanned.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT,
  salary DOUBLE
)
PARTITIONED BY (country STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/user/data/employee.csv' INTO TABLE employee
PARTITION (country='USA');
```

### Indexing

Indexing is a way to improve query performance by creating an index on specific columns in a table. It allows Hive to quickly locate data that satisfy certain conditions.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT,
  salary DOUBLE
)
PARTITIONED BY (country STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
SORTED BY (name ASC, salary DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_name ON TABLE employee (name) AS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler';
```
