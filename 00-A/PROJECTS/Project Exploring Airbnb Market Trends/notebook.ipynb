{"cells":[{"source":"![NYC Skyline](nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n\nRecall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**data/airbnb_price.csv**\nThis is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n\n**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\nThis is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`description`**: listing description\n- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n\n**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\nThis is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"c747d469-ee97-4b95-880f-feefd5456042","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n#
