Hi! I am Hai Nguyen (o￣∇￣)ノ♪. <br>

<br>
I came from Bac Ninh in Vietnam. In 2014, I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/" target="_blank">HUST</a>) majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications. I had spent 5 years working in several industrial fields (Embedded System Software, Factory Automation, Database) in both Vietnam and Japan. In 2019, I decided to pursue my graduate study at Ritsumeikan University. In 2021, I got my Master's degree from Ritsumeikan majoring in <a href="http://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/gsise/" target="_blank" >Advance Information and Science Engineering</a>.　
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;'> 
Currently, I am working as a Python developer in the research department of <a href="https://www.ics-p.net/" target="_blank"><strong>ICS Partners</strong></a>, which is located in Kyoto Research Park (<a href="http://www.krp.co.jp/" target="_blank"><strong>KRP</strong></a>).
My role is to apply Machine Learning & NLP algorithms to develop Computer Vision Web APIs for building Robotic Process Automation (RPA) products.

My research interests cover the following topics Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science and OpenCV-OCR.</p>
