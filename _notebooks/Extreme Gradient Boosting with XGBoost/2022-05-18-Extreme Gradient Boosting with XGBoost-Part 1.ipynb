    "> Do you know the basics of supervised learning and want to use state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets? Gradient boosting is currently one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting, with models using XGBoost regularly winning online data science competitions and being used at scale across different industries. \n",

    "    - Optimized gradient-boosting machine learning library\n",

    "\n",
    "It's time to create your first XGBoost model! As Sergey showed you in the video, you can use the scikit-learn .fit() / .predict() paradigm that you are already familiar to build your XGBoost models, as the xgboost library has a scikit-learn compatible API!\n",

    "Here, you'll be working with churn data. This dataset contains imaginary data from a ride-sharing app with user behaviors over their first month of app usage in a set of imaginary cities as well as whether they used the service 5 months after sign-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to use the first month's worth of data to predict whether the app's users will remain users of the service at the 5 month mark. This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, you'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "- Import xgboost as xgb.\n",
    "- Create training and test sets such that 20% of the data is used for testing. Use a random_state of 123.\n",
    "- Instantiate an XGBoostClassifier as xg_cl using xgb.XGBClassifier(). Specify n_estimators to be 10 estimators and an objective of 'binary:logistic'. Do not worry about what this means just yet, you will learn about these parameters later in this course.\n",
