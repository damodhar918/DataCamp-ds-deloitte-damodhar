## Introduction

This is a repository dedicated to the courses I have completed on DataCamp for data science. Some of the exercises corresponding to the courses will not run locally because I haven't included the necessary additional code that DataCamp supplies. 

## Courses Completed

Here are the courses I have completed on DataCamp:

- Intermediate Importing Data in Python
- Writing Efficient Python Code
- Pandas AI: Mastering DataFrames
- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1 and Part 2)
- Merging DataFrames with pandas
- Introduction to Python
- Cleaning Data in Python
